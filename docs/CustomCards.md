# Custom Cards

see `src/lib/cards` for how cards are made.

Notes:

- Cards should be styled to work in light and dark mode (with dark: class modifier) as well as when cards are colorful (= bg-color-400/500 for the card) (with accent: modifier).
- Please test newly created cards:
  - in light/dark mode
  - with and without colored cards
  - in edit mode and not in edit mode
  - on mobile and desktop (note that there's two different mobile "modes", one dependent on screen size and one enabled when pointer: coarse)
